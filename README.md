Overview
In this project, we define a person struct and a contactInfo struct. The person struct has fields for firstName, lastName, and contactInfo, which includes email and zipCode. The project demonstrates various operations on a person object, such as updating the first name and printing the person's information.

Usage
To run this project, you can follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine:

shell
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/sinhay13/go-person-struct.git
Navigate to the project directory:

shell
Copy code
cd go-person-struct
Run the Go program:

shell
Copy code
go run main.go
This will execute the Go program, which creates a person object, updates the first name, and prints the person's information.

How It Works
The project demonstrates the creation of a person object using different approaches, including setting field values directly, initializing with named fields, and using pointers.

It shows how to update the first name of a person object using both regular methods and pointer methods.

The print method of the person struct is used to display the person's information, including all the fields in the person and contactInfo structs.
